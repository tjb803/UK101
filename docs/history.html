<h1>Some History</h1>
<p><img src="image/board1.jpg" alt="main board" align="left"/>
The Compukit UK101 was a single-board computer from the early days
of hobby computing in the late 1970's and early 1980's.
It had a 6502 processor running at 1Mhz and a small amount of RAM,
usually 4K or 8K bytes.</p>  
<p>There was a full size, reasonable quality proper keyboard for input;
video output, as was common for hobby computers at the time, was got
by hooking up to a standard TV set and program storage via a 300
baud cassette tape interface. 
The machine was essentially a clone of the Ohio Superboard II from the 
US company OSI but was modified to work rather better with the UK TV 
standard.</p>
<p>Like most machines of the time it had a BASIC interpreter availavble
in ROM and and additional &quot;monitor&quot; ROM with provided the 
bootstrap functions and basic I/O facilities.
<p>The Compukit UK101 was sold by as a kit from the Compshop in New Barnet
and originally cost about &pound;219.00.  
It was first published and described as a series of articles in the 
magazine <i>Practical Electronics</i> starting in June 1979 and was 
supported by the magazine for a good few years.  
<p>The Compukit UK101 was the first computer I owned and I still have it
somewhere in my loft.
One day I will get it out and get it working again.

<p>By the way, although the UK101 was the first machine I owned, the first
machine I did any programming on was an Elliott 803
You can find my simulation of that machine
