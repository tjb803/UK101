<h1>Some History</h1>
<p><img src="image/board1.jpg" alt="main board" align="left"/>
The Compukit UK101 was a single-board computer from the early days
of hobby computing in the late 1970's and early 1980's.
It had a 6502 processor running at 1Mhz and a small amount of RAM,
usually 4K or 8K bytes.</p>  
<p>There was a full size, reasonable quality proper keyboard for input;
video output, as was common for hobby computers at the time, was got
by hooking up to a standard TV set and program storage was via a 300
baud cassette tape interface. 
The machine was essentially a clone of the 
<a href="operation.html#osi">Ohio Superboard II</a> from the 
US company OSI but was modified to work rather better with the UK TV 
standard.</p>
<p>Like most machines of the time it had a BASIC interpreter available
in ROM and an additional &quot;monitor&quot; ROM with provided the 
bootstrap functions and basic I/O facilities.
<p>The Compukit UK101 was sold by as a kit from the Compshop in New Barnet
and originally cost about &pound;219.00.  
It was first published and described as a series of articles in the 
magazine <i>Practical Electronics</i> starting in June 1979 and was 
supported by the magazine for a good few years.  
<p>The Compukit UK101 was the first computer I owned and I still have it
somewhere in my loft.
One day I will get it out and get it working again.

<h2 id="arch">Machine Architecture</h2>
<p>The UK101 was a very simple machine, apart from the 6502 processor,
a 6850 asynchronous communications controller and RAM and ROM chips,
just about everything was built from standard TTL logic - there were
no custom ICs at all.
The was an 'expansion' socket on the PCB (the big empty socket on the 
right above the keyboard in the picture above) that provided access 
to all the address bus and data bus lines plus various other control 
signals, allowing, in theory, a range of additional hardware to be
plugged in.</p>
<p>The 6502 could address 64kB of RAM and everything on the machine 
was memory-mapped into that address space:</p>
<table frame="box" rules="all" cellpadding="5">
<tr valign="top"><td>0x0000<br>onwards</td>
<td>Start of RAM
<p>The standard machine came with 4K of RAM but there were sockets on
the PCB to allow up to 8K to be installed (in 1K increments).  
Since the next thing in memory was at address 0xA000, in theory,
with a suitable expansion board, you could have up to 40K of RAM
installed - this would have been rather expensive in 1979!</p></td></tr>
<tr><td>0xA000<br>to<br>0xBFFF</td>
<td>The BASIC ROM 
<p>This was 8K and was actually in 4 2K ROMs (as a single 8K ROM wasn't
available at any reasonable price).  
However the PCB could support a single 8K ROM if one became available 
leaving 3 empty sockets for potential use by other ROM software.</p></td></tr> 
<tr><td>0xD000<br>to<br>0xD3FF</td>
<td>The video RAM
<p>The standard machine had 1K of video RAM arranged as 16 rows of 64
characters, although due to the simple video display circuitry (there
was no custom video chip remember) not all those 64 characters could be 
seen on a standard TV.
You normally got about 48 characters displayed which curiously were not 
the first or last 48 from the line but 48 starting from somewhere in
the middle, usually starting at about 13 characters in.</p></td></tr>
<tr><td>0xDF00</td>
<td>The Keyboard
<p>The keyboard was mapped as a single byte. 
The keys were arranged in an 8x8 matrix and to read the keyboard you 
had to write a 'column' byte to the keyboard port and read back a
'row' byte.
Using the written 'column' value and the returned 'row' value you
could determine which key or keys was pressed.  
The monitor contained routines to do this and decode the key to 
its ASCII character value.</p></td></tr>
<tr><td>0xF000<br>and<br>0xF001</td>
<td>The Cassette port
<p>This was actually the status and data ports of the 6850 ACIA, which
was used to drive the simple cassette interface.
No interrupts were used so you had to poll the status port when reading
or writing the cassette to see when data was available.</p></td></tr>
<tr><td>0xF800<br>to<br>0xFFFF</td>
<td>The Monitor ROM
<p>The top 2K was the monitor which contained some basic machine operating 
routines - such as reading and decoding the keyboard and reading and 
writing characters to and from the cassette interface.</p></td></tr>

<h3>Modifications</h3>
<p>Because of the simple nature of the hardware, it was very easy to 
modify the machine.
Some very common modifications included:
<ul>
<li>External power supply
<p>There was an on-board power supply (it just needed an external
transformer), but it was under-rated and the voltage regulator chip
was prone to failing.
So it was quite common to remove it and use a rather better external
power supply.</p></li>
<li>Overclocking the the CPU
<p>The 6502 had a 1&mu;s cycle time and used a 1MHz external clock to
generate it, however most CPUs could run quite happily at faster clock
speeds.  
Since the UK101 had all its clock signals derived from a single 8MHz 
timer it was easy to find a 2MHz signal and attach it to the CPU 
clock pin, effectively doubling the machine speed.</p></li>
<li>Improving the video
<p>It was relatively simple to double the video RAM to 2K and then
display 32 lines instead of the standard 16, which was a very useful
extension.</p></li>
<li>Increasing the cassette baud rate
<p>The standard cassette interface ran at 300 baud which was reliable
but pretty slow.  
It was simple to double this to 600 and even double again to 1200,
as long as you used a decent quality tape recorder  - running the 
CPU at 2MHz also helped a lot when trying to get 1200 baud to work
reliably.</p></li>
