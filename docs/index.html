<h2 id=intro>Introduction</h2>
<h3>Project Aims</h3>
<p>The aim of this project is to produce a simulation of the Compukit
UK101 computer that is capable of running original UK101 programs.
In particular it is an aim to be able to run the Premier Publications
<i>Invaders</i> space invaders game, which ought to be a good
test of a working system.</p>

<p>The project has been written in Java to enable it to run easily 
on most systems and the user interface elements have been written as 
simple Java Swing interfaces.
<h3>Current Status</h3>
<p>The project provides a fairly complete emulation of a standard UK101.
The default configuration has 8KB of RAM and an original 16 row by 48
column video display.
It is fitted with the original BASIC ROMs and the 
<a href="http://uk101.sourceforge.net/docs/pdf/newmon.pdf">New Monitor</a>
(or MONUK02) monitor ROM.
Many of these parameters can be changed via a set of 
<a href="config.html">configuration properties</a>.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Ohio Scientific Superboard II</h2>
<p>The UK101 was heavily based on and very similar to the US Ohio Scientific
Superboard II machine. 
By using the ROM images from the <a href="operation.html#osi">Superboard</a>
and setting the correct keyboard and video configuration this simulation 
will work as an OSI machine and run programs for the Superboard.
A suitable set of ROMs and a sample set of configuration properties
can be be found in the <code>samples/superboard</code> directory.</p>

<h2>Acknowledgements</h2>
<p>Although I don't know any of these people, I think they all deserve an
honourable mention for starting me down a path which still continues!</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Dr A A Berk</b> - listed as the author of the UK101 manual and the 
original series of <i>Practical Electronics</i> artiles, so I guess largely
responsible for the machine.</li>
<li><b>Mr David Fine</b> - whose name and phone number were in the manual 
for when you needed <q>technical advice</q>.
As someone who soldered their kit together a little too quickly and then 
found it didn't quite work first time, I phoned him and he got me up and 
running.</li>
<li><b>Phil Reeve</b> - listed as the author of the 
<a href="samples.html#invade">Invaders</a> game - many a happy hour.</li>
</ul> 
<p>And these people have helped significantly with testing, suggestions,
explanations, programs etc:</p>
