<h1>Quick Start</h1>
<p>This is a quick overview of how to run a simple program using the simulator.
There is a lot more detail in the <a href="operation.html">operation guide</a>
and in the 
<a href="http://uk101.sourceforge.net/docs/pdf/manual.pdf">Compukit UK101 Manual</a>.</p>
<p>In this example we'll just run a trivial BASIC program that prints a message
onto the screen.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Installation</h2>
<p>If you haven't already done so install the simulator and the related sample
programs and documentation by unzipping the rumtime package into a 
subdirectory on your machine.
Make sure you have Java 5 (or later) installed and working - try typing the 
command &quot;<kbd>java&nbsp;&#8209;version</kbd>&quot; at a terminal or command prompt 
if you are not sure.</p>
<p>After unzipping the runtime package you will find these files and directories:</p>
<blockquote><table frame="void" rules="none" cellpadding="0">
<tr><td><code>uk101-n.n.n.jar</code></td><td/><td>The program JAR file</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>readme.txt</code></td><td width="15"/><td>Latest information</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>license.txt</code></td><td/><td>The BSD license file</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>docs/</code></td><td/><td>A copy of the latest documentation</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>icons/</code></td><td/><td>Some icons that can be associated with the 
program if required</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>samples/</code></td><td/><td>Sample programs, tapes and properties
files.</td></tr>
</table></blockquote>
<hr>
<h2>Start Up</h2>
To start the simulator enter the following command at a terminal or command
prompt:
<blockquote><pre>
<code>java -jar uk101-n.n.n.jar</code>
</pre></blockquote>    
<p>on some systems (such as Windows) you should also be able to double-click
on the JAR file to to launch the application.</p>
<p>The simulator should start and display a window containing several smaller
windows something like this:</p>
<table frame="void" rules="none">
<tr>
<td valign="middle" width="100"><b>Top left is video display</b></td>
<td rowspan="3"><img src="image/qs1.jpg" alt="Main Frame"/></td>
<td align="right" valign="middle" width="100"><b>Top right is the machine control
and configuration panel</b></td>
</tr>
<tr><td><br><br><br></td></tr>
<tr>
<td valign="middle" width="100"><b>Bottom left is keyboard for typing into the 
machine</b></td>
<td align="right" valign="middle" width="100"><b>Bottom right is the cassette
recorder for loading and saving programs</b></td>
</tr> 
</table>
<hr>
<h2>A Note About the Keyboard</h2>
<p>I'll mention this right up front, as it often causes confusion! 
<b>In the current simulator implementation you can only type using the PC 
keyboard keys if the keyboard window is active (and therefore has 
input focus).
If you click on one of the other windows (perhaps the cassette recorder) 
that other window will get focus and the keyboard will appear not to work - 
make sure you reselect the keyboard window when trying to type!</b>
I'll have to find a way to fix this in the future.</p>
<p>You can also operate the keyboard by clicking on keys with the mouse but
this is rather tedious!</p>  
<hr>
<h2 id="boot">Booting the System</h2>
<p>When the system starts or when it is <a href="#reset">reset</a> the screen 
will display a bootstrap start-up message and wait for a key to be pressed.
With the monitor ROM installed by default (known as the &quot;New Monitor&quot;
or &quot;MONUK02&quot;) the initial screen will look something like the left 
hand screen-shot below.</p>
<p>The system is waiting for one of the keys <i>M</i> (for <i>Monitor</i>),
<i>C</i> (for <i>Cold Start</i>) or <i>W</i> (for <i>Warm Start</i>).
<dl compact>
<dt><i>Cold Start</i></dt>
<dd>A cold start completely resets the system and clears
the memory, it then enters the BASIC interpreter.</dd>
<dt><i>Warm Start</i>
</dt><dd>A warm start recovers from a reset without clearing 
memory.
Normally this re-enters BASIC with the previous program still loaded.</dd>
<dt><i>Monitor</i>
</dt><dd>The monitor is a low-level machine mode monitor 
function.</dd> 
</dl>
<p>Ensure that the <i>SHIFT LOCK</i> key in the keyboard window is pressed
(which should be the default at start up, so you shouldn't have to do
anything) and press the <i>C</i> key to perform a Cold Start.
The system will then prompt for <code>MEMORY SIZE?</code> followed by
<code>TERMINAL WIDTH?</code>.
Press the <i>RETURN</i> key to accept default values for both these 
prompts and the system should respond with some messages and an <code>OK</code>
prompt from the BASIC interpreter - see right hand screen-shot.</p>
<table frame="void">

<td><img src="image/qsb.gif" alt="BASIC Prompt"/></td></tr>
</table>
<p>You are now ready for some authentic 1979-vintage BASIC programming!</p>
<p>You could try typing a simple program such as <code>10 PRINT "HELLO!"</code>
followed by <code>LIST</code> to list it or <code>RUN</code> to 
execute it.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Loading and Running a Program</h2>
<p>Programs would normally be loaded from cassette tapes.
To see how this works, first type the command <code>LOAD</code> at the 
BASIC <code>OK</code> prompt then press <i>RETURN</i>.
Not much appears to happen - you may notice the cursor has stopped
flashing - but the system is now waiting for input from the 
cassette player.</p>
<p>Press the <i>Open</i> button on the cassette player window, and in
the file selection dialog choose the <i>samples</i> folder, then the 
<i>basic</i> folder and then select the file called <i>hello.basic</i>.
With the tape loaded in the cassette player press the <i>Play</i> button
and you will see the program load into the machine, just as if it had 
been typed.</p>
<p>When the program finishes loading (<i>hello.basic</i> is just a two-line
program) you need to press <i>Stop</i> on the cassette player, then switch 
back to the keyboard (make sure you click on the keyboard window to 
activate it) and press the <i>SPACE</i> bar.
This will end the loading mode and return to accepting input from the 
keyboard - you should see the cursor flashing again.
Type <code>RUN</code> to execute the newly loaded program.
<table frame="void">
<tr><td><img src="image/qsl.gif" alt="Loaded Program"/></td>
<td><img src="image/qsh.gif" alt="Hello World"/></td></tr>
</table>
<hr>
<h2 id="reset">Reseting the Machine</h2>
<p>If things go wrong you can <i>reset</i> the machine and return to the 
boot-up prompt.
Another <i>C</i> for a <i>Cold Start</i> should get it all working again
although a cold-start will always wipe out the contents of the memory.
<p>To perform a reset you can either press the <i>Reset</i> button 
in the <b>Debug</b> section of the 
<a href="operation.html#opctl">machine control panel</a>, or you can use 
the <i>RESET</i> keys on the keyboard. 
On a real UK101 you had to press both <i>RESET</i> keys together to
reset, on the simulator keyboard you simulate this by clicking either one
of the two keys using both mouse buttons at once.</p>
