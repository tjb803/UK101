<h3 id="runbas">Loading and Running BASIC programs</h3>
<p>To load and run a program written in BASIC:
<ol>
<li><a href=quickstart.html#boot>Reset</a> the machine and do a cold start to
enter the BASIC interpreter.</li>
<li>Type the <code>LOAD</code> and press <i>Enter</i>.
The cursor will stop flashing to indicate input has been switched to the
cassette player.</li>
<li>Use the <i>Cassette Recorder</i> to open the program source code file
and press the <i>Play</i> button.
You should see the program being loaded.</li>
<li>When the loading has finished press the <i>SPACE</i> bar to switch 
control back to the keyboard (the cursor should start flashing again).</li>
<li>Type <code>RUN</code> and press <i>Enter</i> to run the program.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="runmc">Loading and Running Machine Code Tapes</h3>
<p>Machine code program tapes need to be loaded using the Monitor:
<ol>
<li><a href=quickstart.html#boot>Reset</a> the machine and enter the
Monitor by pressing <i>M</i>.</li>
<li>Start the Monitor load routine by pressing <i>L</i>.
There's no visible cue that anything has happened but the system should
now be waiting for input from the cassette player.</li>
<li>Use the <i>Cassette Recorder</i> to open the program tape file
and press the <i>Play</i> button.
You should see the program being loaded.</li>
<li>Machine code tapes normally have trigger commands embedded at the
end to automatically run the program that was loaded.</li>
</ol>
<p>Often machine code is loaded in two or more phases, where the first phase 
loads a more sophisticated checksum loader that then loads the remaining 
code.</p>

<p>This is game kindly sent to me by Chic McGregor.
It was first published in the July 1980 issue of <i>Personal Computer World</i> and 
is provided here exactly as originally published.
When you run the game it can provide some instructions on how to use it.</p>
<img src="image/blackbox.gif" alt="Black Box"/>
<p>There's an interesting history to this particular program as it was almost 
certainly the first <q>user written</q> BASIC program for the UK101.
How can we know this?  Chic tells me that the very first shipment of UK101
machines were sent out without any BASIC ROMs because the ROMs were not ready
due to some issues in the factory in Scotland that was producing them.
As it happened Chic (who bought one of those very first machines) was also
a young engineer working in that very factory - so not surprisingly managed
to get hold of a set of ROMs ahead of anyone else.</p>

<p>This is a version of the ubiquitous &quot;first-person 3D maze&quot; type of game,

<img src="image/maze.gif" alt="Labyrinth"/>
<p>It was written for my modified UK101 and requires a 32-line display and the
CEGMON monitor installed; it also works better with a faster CPU.
So ensure the following <a href="config.html">configuration options</a> 
are specified when starting the simulator:</p>
<blockquote><pre>
-p rom.monitor=CEGMON,video.rows=32,cpu.speed=4
</pre></blockquote>

<p>This game was written by <a href="http://www.cse.dmu.ac.uk/~mward/">Martin Ward</a>
and is an impressive achievement squeezing just about everything it can into 
the 8K BASIC memory space!</p>
<p>This game must be run on a 32-line display and requires a patched version of the 
standard monitor ROM that fully supports 32 lines.
A suitable monitor called NEWMON32.ROM can be found in the <samp>samples/roms</samp>
directory.
Ensure the following <a href="config.html">configuration options</a> 
are specified when starting the simulator:</p>
<blockquote><pre>
-p rom.monitor=samples/roms/NEWMON32.ROM,video.rows=32
</pre></blockquote>
<p>It's probably best to run the game with a standard 1MHz CPU speed to start
with until you get the hang of the controls.  
Then maybe switch to 2MHz (or more) for a greater challenge!
<h3>Real-Time Star Trek Instructions</h3>
<p>Real Time Star Trek is, in the modern jargon, a procedurally generated,
open world, RTS (real time strategy) game with destructable environments.</p>
<p>The object of the game is to destroy all the Klingons before the time
runs out:  when they will perfect their secret weapon and take
over the galaxy.</p>
<img src="image/startrek.gif" alt="Star Trek"/>
<p>To execute a function: hold down the function key (a letter)
plus an optional direction key (a digit). 
For example, to move down, firing your phasers and recharging shields
all at the same time, hold down: "I", "5", "P", and "S".</p>
<p>Hold down the key(s) and wait for the function to take effect.
Press the function before pressing the direction.</p>
<p>The numbers around the E show the directions: 1 for straight up etc.</p>
<p>You can operate several functions at the same time, by holding
down more than one key at a time.</p>
<p>Functions are:
<table width="100%">
<tr valign="baseline"><td width="8%">I&nbsp;+&nbsp;dir</td>
<td>Impulse Drive: move around within the current sector</td></tr>
<tr valign="baseline"><td>W&nbsp;+&nbsp;dir</td>
<td>Warp drive: move to an adjacent sector</td></tr>
<tr valign="baseline"><td>T&nbsp;+&nbsp;dir</td>
<td>Fire a photon torpedo in the given direction.
If a torpedo hits a star, it will create a large explosion
which may destroy nearby Klingons (or you!)</td></tr>
<tr valign="baseline"><td>S</td>
<td>Recharge shield energy: hold down to charge your shields up to 
the maximum of 500 energy units. 
Energy is taken from your main energy store, which recharge (by the power plant) 
up to its maximum of 3000 units.</td></tr>
<tr valign="baseline"><td>R</td>
<td>Repair. 
You can repair damage at the cost of energy.</td></tr>
<tr valign="baseline"><td>P</td>
<td>Fire phasers. 
Phasers automatically lock on target and keep firing as long as you hold down 
the P key. 
Phaser effectiveness decreases with distance. 
The Klingons only have phasers, so their weapons do more damage the closer you 
are to them.</td></tr>
<tr valign="baseline"><td>G</td>
<td>Galaxy Scan: displays the map of the galaxy for as long as you hold
down the G key.</td></tr>
</table>
<p>The area on the left is the short range scan, showing the current sector:</p>
<table width="100%">
<tr><td width="8%">E</td><td>The Enterprise (you!)</td></tr>
<tr><td>K</td><td>Klingon</td></tr>
<tr><td>B</td><td>Starbase</td></tr>
<tr><td>*</td><td>Star</td></tr>
</table>
<p>The bottom right is the long range scan, showing your sector and
the eight surrounding sectors:</p>
<table width="100%">
<tr><td width="8%">Tens digit</td><td>number of Klingons in that sector</td></tr>
<tr><td>Units digit</td><td>number of starbases in that sector</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>edge of galaxy</td></tr>
</table>
<p>To dock with a starbase, move next to it (using the impulse drive I+direction)
and press Y. 
This will repair all damage, give you full energy,
and 8 torpedoes, and reduce shields to zero. 
So hold down S afterwards to charge up your shields again.</p>

<p>This is a copy of Premier Publication's excellent <i>Invaders</i>
space invaders game.</p>
<img src="image/invaders.gif" alt="Invaders"/>
<p>The game was intended to be played on a standard 1Mhz processor, 
if you have over-clocked the processor (see <a href="config.html#config">
system configuration</a>) it may run too fast.
Some old notes I have suggest that location $0F69 defines the game speed
with the default value being 20 - on a 2MHz machine this might be best 
changed to 40, it says.</p>
<p>To move the laser the <i>CTRL</i> is used to go left and the 
<i>left-SHIFT</i> key is used to go right.
On a real UK101 the CTRL-key is above the SHIFT-key so CTRL-for-left
and SHIFT-for-right makes sense.
Unfortunately these keys are the other way up on a PC keyboard so
this is not ideal!
I once knew some locations to patch to change these keys, but I can no
longer find those notes - sorry! 
You should set the keyboard to <a href="operation.html#kbmode">game mode</a>
to play the game.
Once the game is loaded you can reset the machine and perform a
<a href="quickstart.html#boot">warm start</a> to restart it at
any time.</p>

<p>This is a copy of Craig Clapp's excellent <i>8K Super Invaders</i>
space invaders game, which shows just how much could be done
with the limited character set graphics.</p>
<img src="image/sinvaders.gif" alt="Super Invaders"/>
<p>This games is a mix of machine code and BASIC, but it is loaded 
as if it were a BASIC program and automatically handles loading both 
the machine code and BASIC parts.
If you do a warm start you can restart it just by typing <code>RUN</code>.
<p>This game rather cleverly hooked into the ACIA timing signals to 
ensure it always ran at the correct speed, even if the CPU was over-clocked
to 2MHz - my thanks to Craig for explaining to me how this worked so I 
could ensure the emulator handled it correctly!
It would also produce some simple sound effects if you hooked up a 
speaker or earphone to the ACIA output - this is not implemented in
the simulation yet but I hope to add it soon.</p>
<p>To move the laser the <i>left-SHIFT</i> key is used to go left and the 
<i>Z</i> key is used to go right.
The <i>right-SHIFT</i> key is used to fire, but note there are some 
problems when trying to use both shift keys independently on Windows
(something to do with the way Java reports the key events), 
so you should use an alternative to the right-SHIFT if you can.  
When the keyboard is set to <a href="operation.html#kbmode">game mode</a>
either the <i>right-CTRL</i> or the <i>Windows-Menu</i> key (both normally
directly beneath the right-SHIFT) can be used as alternatives
for the right-SHIFT key.</p>

additional machine code which it loads automatically.

this or if it is related to the simulation!

<hr>
<h2 id="format">Binary, ASCII and Audio Tape Formats</h2>
<p>When the UK101 wrote data to a cassette tape it was written as a 
series of bytes.
Although most of the bytes that were written were standard ASCII
characters, the tapes would include some control characters,
some padding NUL (0x00) characters and possibly some bytes
whose values were outside the range of the standard character
set.
If these tapes are saved as PC files, the resulting file is not
guaranteed to be viewable on the PC and can probably not 
be successfully edited using standard PC editors without some
data corruption.</p>
<p>To help overcome these problems the simulator allows tapes to
be stored in one of three formats:</p>
<dl>
<dt><i>Binary</i></dt>
<dd>This the raw bytes format as would have been stored on a real
cassette tape.
If you recover a program or data from an old cassette tape it
will be in <i>binary</i> format.
<p>All the sample machine code programs are in <i>binary</i> format
and have a file extension of <code>.tape</code>.</p></dd>
<dt><i>ASCII</i></dt>
<dd>This is a converted format that can be viewed and edited 
on the PC using any standard PC editor (for example Notepad
on Windows) without any data loss or data corruption.
<p>The conversion leaves any standard ASCII character unchanged,
it detects line ends and stores them as standard PC style
line ends and any other unrecognised byte is converted to an
escaped form <code>&#92;nn</code> where <code>nn</code> 
is a pair of hexadecimal digits.</p>
<p>All the sample BASIC programs are in <i>ASCII</i> format and
have a file extension of <code>.basic</code>.</p></dd>
<dt><i>Audio</i></dt>
<dd>This is the original Kansas City Standard encoded audio format 
which is stored in the form of a WAV file.
The audio encoding parameters can be controlled by properties
in the <a href="config.html#kcs">system configuraton</a>.</dd>
</dl>
<p>The simulator will correctly recognise and load tapes any of 
the three formats and can save in any selected format.
If you are saving a BASIC program it would make sense to 
save in <i>ASCII</i> format (which is the default) as the 
resulting program can then be easily viewed and edited on the PC.
If you are saving a tape to potentially load back onto a 
real UK101 you will need to ensure it is in <i>binary</i>
or maybe <i>audio</i> format.
The utility programs <a href="utilities.html#tread">Tape Reader</a>
and <a href="utilities.html#twrite">Tape Writer</a> can be used
to quickly convert between the various formats.</p>
<p>When an audio file is produced the waveform created can either be an
approximation to the output generated by the real hardware (which is 
the default) or pure sine waves (which is probably what the Kansas City
standard specified).</p>

<h2 id="decode">Recovering Programs from Old Cassette Tapes</h2>
<p>If you have original UK101 programs on old cassette tapes it is 
usually possible to recover them on a PC so they can be loaded
and used with the simulator, provided the tapes are still playable
and provided you still have something to play them with.
The first steps are to record the cassette as an audio WAV file on
the PC:
<ol><li>Attach a cassette tape player to the sound card in your PC.
I used an old (but good quality) 
<a href="http://www.walkmancentral.com/products/wm-dd">Sony Walkman</a>
and plugged the headphone output into the line-input on the PC (it's
best not to use the microphone input) and set the volume to about 7.</li>
<li>Play the tape and record the sound to a WAV file, setting to Mono
(rather than Stereo) if you can and sampling at a high rate such as 
44.1kHz or 48kHz.
I used <a href="http://audacity.sourceforge.net/">Audacity</a> to do
the recording and exporting as a WAV, remembering to trim off any 
unwanted blanks and noise at the beginning and end of the recording.
Make sure you save as an uncompressed WAV file, not an MP3.</li>
</ol>
<p>If the recording is good quality and the original tape was in reasonably
good condtion it should be possible to load the resulting WAV file
directly into the simulator by playing it with the
<a href="operation.html#opcas">cassette player</a>.
<p>If the recording is poor quality or the original tape was in poor
condition (which is quite likely) further processing might be needed
to recover the data. 
This is done using an excellent piece of software written by Martin Ward 
that can examine and process the WAV file in great detail to recover the 
original data bytes.
The process is something like this:
<ol>
<li>Download and install Martin Ward's
<a href="http://www.cse.dmu.ac.uk/~mward/martin/software/index.html#CUTS">
kansas city tape decoder</a>.
This is a perl script, so might require a few pre-requisites to be gathered
from elsewhere if you are a Windows user (like me).</li> 
<li>Run the perl script to process the WAV file and create the decoded tape.
This might take a little while if the original tape was fairly long.
Hopefully the data will be analysed, processed and extracted correctly - 
Martin's program did a fine job for all the tapes I have found and
tried.</li>
<li>The resulting file will be what I called <i>binary</i> format
(even though it may have a .txt extension).
This can be loaded directly into the simulator as either a BASIC
program or as machine code in the monitor or you can
use the <a href="utilities.html#tread">Tape Reader</a> utility to
convert the binary form to ASCII for easy viewing or editing on the PC.</li>
